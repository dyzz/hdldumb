The new hdld_svr.elf README
===========================

What's all this about?
----------------------

The new server uses UDP, instead of TCP. Because UDP is unreliable,
client asks the server now and then, if there is a need to retransmit
any part of the data.

Basically, protocol works as follows: client tells the server "I'm
want to write # sectors, starting at #"; then it starts to flood the
server with data via UDP. If client sends the data too fast server
will miss some packets and they should be retransmitted. If client
sends the data too slow, you waste bandwidth.

The client has been carefully optimized to keep a constant transfer
rate and there is no configuration necessary.


HOWTO setup environment
-----------------------

Copy all files in the following location:
	hdl_dump/svr/iop3/
Open term, navigate to the same location, execute assemble.sh

You need Subversion client, wget and Internet connection in order
to succeed.

When script completes, use the following commands to build
the alternative IOP module:
	cd tcpip/
	make
	ls -l bin/


HOWTO build loader
------------------

Copy new ps2iop.irx on top of the old one:
	cd hdl_dump/svr/irx
	mv ps2ip.irx ps2ip_orig.irx
	cd ../iop2/
	cp tcpip/bin/ps2ip.irx ../irx/

Patch hdl_dump/svr/ee/loader.c:82 - comment-out the line
	#define LOAD_SERVER

Build the new loader:
	cd hdl_dump/svr
	make clean
	make
